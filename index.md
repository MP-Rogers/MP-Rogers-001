# About Me
  I'm MP Rogers. I'm a Jamaican, a marine biologist and all around nerd. This is where I get to share all of that nerdiness with you.
  I'm looking forward to it.
  I'll be building this website out, bit by bit, and learning as I go. Glad to have anyone reading along for the journey

## This Website
  This is my personal website. The hope is for this to do several things for me
 + It will let me document what i'm doing, so I can loook back later
 + It lets me write more, and communicate
 + It lets me share my interests and gives me more motivation to keep at it
 + Maybe it will let me pick up some stuff on website development

## This page
This is the home page. I'll see if it works.
Eventually this page will be for navigation through the website
