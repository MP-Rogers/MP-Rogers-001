# About Me


  I'm MP Rogers. I'm a Jamaican, a marine biologist and all around nerd. This is where I get to share all of that nerdiness with you.
  I'm looking forward to it. In Particular, I plan to be sharing some of my marine nerdiness, and some analysis on little things I find interesting.
  I'll be building this website out, bit by bit, and learning as I go. Glad to have anyone reading along for the journey.
