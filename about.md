This is all about me. My name is Matthew-Pierre Rogers. I'm a Jamaican, a marine biologist and a PADI open water diver (for now). This website is going to do a couple of things.

Firstly, it's practice. I'll learn the basics of keeping a website like this by doing. Its also good practice writing, and learning to communicate is alwasy a good thing.

Secondly, its documentation. It gives me a place to keep any little projects I do. I can look back and see how far i've progressed(or regressed). It also lets me show
other people what i've done before.

I'll come back and edit this page at a later date, but thats it for now.
