# Welcome

This is the first blog post on my little site. I want to use this page to learn new things for formatting.
So I will use in here for **practice**. Because practice makes permanent.

## Reasons I started this website

I had a couple of reasons for starting this originally.
+ It gives an opportunity to write more and get better at communicating
+ It gives me a chance to share marine knowledge and analysis
+ It gives me a chance to document cool stuff i've seen and done

So now, I hopefully stay consistent. I should keep learning, keep updating and improving,
until this becomes a little MP Journal.
