# Get to Know Me

My name is Matthew-Pierre Rogers, but you'll see MP around this site.
I'm a young jamaican, a marine biologist and a lover of the ocean.

I graduated recently(2022) from the University of the West Indies and now, I am seeing how I can make the best use of my marine biology to support, not just me, but the seas of Jamaica and the wider Caribbean.
Marine Biology is a pretty broad field. In fact, I think a good idea for one my first posts is on just how diverse life in the sea is, with some of my favourite organisms.

Currently, I work with [Kee Farms](https://www.keefarms.com/), a start-up bringing seaweed farming and mariculture in general to Jamaica and the Caribbean. 
You'll be hearing more about my work and adventures there as I keep posting. I'm also grateful to be accepted for an internship at the Discovery Bay Marine Lab, 
which will give me an opportunity to work under more seasoned marine scientists, help out with research, and tighten up my own scuba and scientific skills.
