So about a week ago, on February 11, 2023, I went on a dive trip with my team at Kee Farms. Here is a little bit of that story.

## The Goals
      At Kee Farms, to put it simply, we grow marine products like seaweed. However, we are still in the learning process. Our first batch of seaweed was depleted. So we needed a new starting crop to start growing. This meant taking a team out into the wild to find and gather some wild seaweed.
      Ideally, we wanted the same species of seaweed we had been growing before. Right now, we are focusing on a red seaweed known as *Gracilaria*. *Gracilaria* is a useful and popular red seaweed. Different species of *Gracilaria* are grown in other parts of the world. Here in Jamaica, we call it "irish moss" and traditionally for it, but our company is among the first to farm it. Here you can see some of the *Gracilaria* from our first round of collection dives. This specific species is called *Gracilaria domingensis*.

## The Start
     I'll be honest. I had mixed feelings about this trip to start. Our first batch of seaweed came from a site named White Horses in St. Thomas. Its called that because the waves crashing look like..well..white horses. In other words, the water gets pretty rough. The roads to and from that site are pretty rough in their own right. The first trip was pretty rough in its own right. The second trip to White Horses was even worse. That time, the other divers and I had gotten into a mess. We collected no seaweed and almost got ourselves seriously hurt. It was a textbook case of horrible conditions. Visibility was less than three feet, surge was rough and the current pushed us towards rocks with some serious force.

  But as the leader for the last dive, my team and I made sure we analyzed our loss(after a beer) ad figured out what we could do better. One of the major steps was to reach our dive site early, before the water picked up for the day. We had tried to reach early on the previous trip, but due to circumstances, we didnt reach until 1pm, when the sea was already rough.
  
  So this time, we left out at 4:30 am. So after a wonderful 4 hours  of sleep, we got driving. A contact had advised us of a new dive site. The drive was long, but they had done some paving on the roads. It wasn't great, but I could see the improvement. We got to see some nicce views

  We kept driving and arrived around 8am. And then after stretching our legs, we got to work.
